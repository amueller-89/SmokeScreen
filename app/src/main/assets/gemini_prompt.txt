# Bar/Pub Smoking Policy Analysis Prompt

Analyze the provided images of bars/pubs and determine the likelihood that smoking is allowed in this establishment. Provide your assessment as a single number from 0-3 based on the scale below:

## Scoring Scale:
- **0**: Definitely non-smoking (clear no-smoking signs, absence of smoking-related items, modern clean environment)
- **1**: Probably non-smoking (no visible smoking indicators, appears to follow smoking bans)
- **2**: Possibly allows smoking (some ambiguous indicators, unclear signage, or mixed signals)
- **3**: Smoking likely allowed (clear smoking indicators like ashtrays, lit cigarettes, smoking signs, or permissive atmosphere)

## Visual Indicators to Look For:

**Strong Smoking Indicators (lean toward 2-3):**
- Ashtrays on tables, bars, or surfaces
- People actively smoking cigarettes, cigars, or pipes
- Signs explicitly allowing smoking
- Cigarette vending machines
- Heavy smoke/haze in the air
- Stained walls/ceilings from smoke
- Designated smoking areas or sections
- Vintage/traditional pub atmosphere that predates smoking bans

**Strong Non-Smoking Indicators (lean toward 0-1):**
- "No Smoking" signs clearly visible
- Modern, clean interior design
- Absence of any smoking paraphernalia
- Food service areas (many jurisdictions ban smoking where food is served)
- Family-friendly atmosphere
- Well-ventilated, bright spaces
- Contemporary health-conscious branding

**Ambiguous Factors:**
- Outdoor seating areas (smoking may be permitted outside)
- Jurisdictional differences (some regions still allow smoking in bars)
- Time period of photo (older photos may show different regulations)
